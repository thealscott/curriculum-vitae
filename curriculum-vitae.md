### Bio
I'm a frontend developer, though I have a few years of backend experience as well. I've worked on small builds as a solo dev as well as on larger builds with a team in both dedicated front-end and back-end roles.

In addition to working with other devs I have often worked closely with designers and creatives to develop a project from concept to end product. This would typically involve providing technical insight into opportunities and limitations, as well as prototyping for selling work into the client or for exploring feasibility.

Over the last 5+ years I've been lucky enough to have the chance to work with a lot of very skilled and talented people on some fun and interesting projects for great brands like Jack Daniels, Disney, Tropicana and Nivea. Please check out my website for a more comprehensive list of projects I've been involved in.

### Skills
This isn't an exhaustive list, but it hopefully highlights the primary areas I have experience and skill in. 

* Responsive and Mobile web principles
* HTML5 & CSS3
* SASS & LESS preprocessors
* JavaScript (& frameworks)
* PHP (& MVC frameworks)
* OOP principles
* RESTful architecture
* Jekyll
* Workflow and deployment tools (e.g. Gulp, Grunt)

### Employment History
*Nov 2014 - Present* **Senior Frontend Developer @ Uber Digital**

Nothing to do with taxis, Uber Digital is an agency dealing in web design and motion graphics. In my time at here I've had the opportunity to work on sites and apps for big brands like KFC, Total and Zurich, as well as smaller brands such as GT Nexus and Landstar. 

The projects have been a mix of internal tools, business facing and consumer facing sites and apps. The variety of the work has meant that I have been constantly faced with new challenges to overcome, often with tight deadlines.

Uber's primary frontend stack utilises Backbone heavily but I have also started working with Redux & React on recent projects. There is a strong emphasis on creating fluid, animated interfaces with rich designs, often incorporating video and photography produced in-house. 

I've also had to learn about .NET and Drupal, as the bulk of our builds utilise one or the other for the backend, depending on client requirments. 

------------------

*Jan 2014 - Nov 2014* **Developer @ Critical Mass London**

My primary role at CM was as a front-end dev. I worked on several web properties of a large international bank in collaboration with a huge, globally distributed team as well as remote third parties who handle back-end and CMS integration. The core challenge of this side of the job was getting to grips with the processes and code base of such large projects.

In addition to that I also worked on some smaller projects in a more independent role. The most significant and challenging of these would be the website for the UK launch of Fire Eater cinnamon whiskey. I worked closely with the designer to develop the core ideas of the creative team and deliver them in a visually rich, responsive site that was extremely well received by the client.

------------------

*Sep 2012 - Jan 2014* **Web Developer @ Agency Republic**

After making the jump up from being a junior this phase of my career saw me becoming more involved in the estimation and planning of projects. I also had the opportunity to take more of a leading role within the team for front-end development and provided oversight and management for freelancers in the team. 

I got to work on a number of big projects in more central roles than previously, which was a great experience. Some highlights include the Agency Republic website, the Like Ralph campaign for Disney and the JD Track Mats campaign. These were all great pieces of work which benefitted from inter-disciplinary cohesion. 

I also worked on a lot of other smaller projects, mostly for Nivea. These were generally smaller scale and less technically interesting, but still challenging for their prolific quantity and localisation requirements.


------------------

*Sep 2010 - Sep 2012* **Junior Developer @ Agency Republic**

As a junior I was often working in a supporting role for the more senior devs; I would do a lot of bug fixing and updates for existing projects. I also worked in more limited roles on some of the largest projects going through the agency, such as the Smirnoff Nightlife Exchange Project and Activia's TLC Plan. 

However, I was still given the opportunity to work independently on interesting projects, albeit at the smaller end of the scale. I did some fun projects for Nivea and Danone Shape especially, who tended towards offering smaller briefs that could be tackled by a team of just one or two devs.

------------------

*May 2010 - Sep 2010* **Creative Support Technologist @ Agency Republic**

The role of a Creative Support Technologist could basically be summed up as a jack of all trades support resource. I was part of a team of three and we worked on pretty much whatever was asked of us. Banner resizes, T&C updates, copy updates, microsite builds, data capture forms, HTML emails; we did it all and much more beside. Plus a lot of making tea. It was often mundane work, but offered great opportunities to learn from the rest of the team. 


### Education
