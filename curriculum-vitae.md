### Bio
I'm a full-stack developer that leans a little to the front-end side of things. I've worked on small builds as a solo dev as well as on larger builds with a team in both dedicated front-end and back-end roles.

In addition to working with other devs I also have experience of working closely with designers and creatives to develop a project from concept to end product. Some of the best projects I have been involved with have had this collaborative process at their heart.   

Over the last 4+ years I've been lucky enough to have the chance to work with a lot of very skilled and talented people on some fun and interesting projects for great brands like Jack Daniels, Disney and Nivea. Please check out my website for a more comprehensive list of projects I've been involved in.

### Skills
This isn't an exhaustive list, but it hopefully highlights the primary areas I have experience and skill in. 

* PHP (& MVC frameworks)
* OOP principles
* RESTful architecture
* Good old HTML5/CSS3
* SASS & LESS preprocessors
* Responsive and Mobile web principles
* JavaScript
* Jekyll
* Workflow and deployment tools (e.g. Grunt, Capistrano)
* Facebook API

### Employment History
*Jan 2014 - Present*
**Developer @ Critical Mass London**

My primary role since being at CM has been as a front-end dev. I have been working on several web properties of a large international bank in collaboration with a huge, globally distributed team as well as remote third parties who handle back-end and CMS integration. The core challenge of this side of the job has been getting to grips with the processes and code base of such large projects.

In addition to that I have also worked on some smaller projects in a more independent role. The most significant and challenging of these would be the website for the UK launch of Fire Eater cinnamon whiskey. I worked closely with the designer to develop the core ideas of the creative team and deliver them in a visually rich responsive site that was extremely well received by the client.
